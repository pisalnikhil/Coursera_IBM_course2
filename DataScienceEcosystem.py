# # Data Science Tools and Ecosystem

# ## In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.

# ### Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
# 1. **Java**
# 2. **Python**
# 3. **R**
# 

# **Objectives:**
# * how deal with ML tools
# * how to use GIT
# * what is R

# ### Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
# 1. **TensorFlow**
# 2. **NumPy**
# 3. **SciPy**
# 4. **Pandas**
# 5. **Matplotlib**

# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python
# $y = x + 2 $
# 
# $y = 2$
# 
# $x^{2} = 2$

# In[1]:


# This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers
(3*4)+5


# In[24]:


#This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60
y = 200
x = 'This will convert'
z = 'minutes to hours by diving by 60 and final answer is'
print(x+ " " +str(y)+ " " + " " + z + " " + str(y/60))
